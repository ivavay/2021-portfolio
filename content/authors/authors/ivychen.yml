name: Ivy Chen 
bio: |
  I'm a senior at UC Santa Cruz studying Cognitive Science (w/ an emphasis on HCI). I love reading, illustrating, and making.
  Though most of my undergraduate work experience has been in academia, I am excited about the area of non-traditional learnings and how that might enable more people to pursue their creative interests. In my free time, I love to spend time exploring the space between reality and art through honing my skills in 3D and creative coding. 
  In the past, I have designed for [Tech4good lab](https://tech4good.soe.ucsc.edu/) and [Cruzhacks 2020](https://www.cruzhacks.com/). Feel free to [reach out](mailto:ichen9@ucsc.edu) to me if you want to chat about anything :)
