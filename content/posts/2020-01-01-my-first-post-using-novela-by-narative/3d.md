### Composition Practice

I wanted to practice my eye for colors, compositon, and movement in this series. I mostly wanted to explore simple geometric shapes with nature. This is also my first time creating in 3D without relying on a tutorial. 

<!-- ## Images -->

<div className="Image__Small">
  <img
    src="./images/3d-thumbnail.png"
    title="3d thumbnail"
    alt="Alt text"
  />
</div>

I hope to spend more time modeling and rendering in my free time after graduation and in between job hunts :)
