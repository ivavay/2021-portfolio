### About Me 

Hello! Thanks for stopping by! I'm Ivy and I'm a senior about to graduate with a degree in cognitive science w/ a concentration in HCI from  UC Santa Cruz. Though most of my design experience has been in academia, I am excited to start designing in the industry. I'd love to work on projects with companies that work at the intersection of non-traditional educational paths and supporting creatives. In my free time, I love to spend time honing my skills in 3D and exploring generative art through [creative coding](https://www.openprocessing.org/user/236304#sketches "creative coding"). As of spring, my current go-to art medium is linocut printmaking. Seeing the freshly pulled print with ink on paper is one of the biggest joys for me in these quarantine times. 


In the past, I have designed for [Tech4good lab](https://tech4good.soe.ucsc.edu/ "Tech4good") and [Cruzhacks 2020](https://2020.cruzhacks.com/ "Cruzhacks"). Feel free to [reach out](mailto:ichen9@ucsc.edu "reach out") to me if you want to connect :)
