### About Me 

Hello! Thanks for stopping by! I'm a senior studying cognitive science w/ a concentration in HCI at UC Santa Cruz. Though most of my undergraduate work experience has been in academia, I am excited to try designing in the industry. I'd love to learn more about companies that work on non-traditional educational paths, supporting creatives, and the landscape of ed tech companies today. In my free time, I love to spend time exploring the space between reality and art through honing my skills in 3D and [creative coding](https://www.openprocessing.org/user/236304#sketches "creative coding"). I also like to do linocut printmaking, illustrations, and photography!


In the past, I have designed for [Tech4good lab](https://tech4good.soe.ucsc.edu/ "Tech4good") and [Cruzhacks 2020](https://www.cruzhacks.com/ "Cruzhacks"). Feel free to [reach out](mailto:ichen9@ucsc.edu "reach out") to me if you want to chat about anything :)
