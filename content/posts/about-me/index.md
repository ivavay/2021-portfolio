### About Me 

Hello! Thanks for stopping by! I'm Ivy and I'm a senior about to graduate with a degree in cognitive science w/ a concentration in HCI from  UC Santa Cruz. As an avid maker and self-learner, I'd love to work on projects that are at the intersection of non-traditional learning and supporting creatives. 

In my free time, I love to spend time honing my skills in 3D and exploring generative art through [creative coding](https://www.openprocessing.org/user/236304#sketches "creative coding"). A retired hobby of mine is [portrait photography](https://vsco.co/ivavay/gallery "portrait photography"), but I'd love to get back into it again post-covid times. 

In the past, I have designed for [Tech4good lab](https://tech4good.soe.ucsc.edu/ "Tech4good") and [Cruzhacks 2020](https://2020.cruzhacks.com/ "Cruzhacks"). Feel free to [reach out](mailto:ichen9@ucsc.edu "reach out") to me if you want to connect :)
