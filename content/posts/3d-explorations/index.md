### Composition Practice

I wanted to practice my eye for colors, compositon, and movement in this series. I mostly wanted to explore simple geometric shapes with nature. This is also my first time creating in 3D without relying on a tutorial. 

<!-- ## Images -->

<div className="Image__Small">
  <img
    src="./images/3d-thumbnail.png"
    title="3d thumbnail"
    alt="Alt text"
  />
  <img
    src="./images/mirror-2.png"
    title="3d thumbnail"
    alt="Alt text"
  />
  <img
    src="./images/mirror-3.png"
    title="3d thumbnail"
    alt="Alt text"
  />
</div>

### Water Sculptures

I used a few tutorials for these. Learned about the ocean modifier & how to use the math function add-on for the different wild torus and flower shapes. 

<div className="Image__Small">
  <img
    src="./images/water-1.png"
    title="water-1"
    alt="Alt text"
  />
  <img
    src="./images/water-2.png"
    title="water-1"
    alt="Alt text"
  />
  <img
    src="./images/water-3.png"
    title="water-1"
    alt="Alt text"
  />
</div>

I hope to spend more time modeling and rendering in my free time after graduation and in between job hunts :)
